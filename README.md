ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Malaysian House Price Index Forecasting & Analysis
This project aims to analyze and forecast the Malaysian House Price Index (HPI) using historical data, time series techniques, deep learning models, and spatial analysis via GIS.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Forecasting Trends
Forecast the future trends of the Malaysian House Price Index based on historical data using time series analysis.

Spatial Distribution Analysis
Analyze the distribution of the house price index across different Malaysian states and identify regions with higher house price indices using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in predicting house price indices in Malaysia.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Time Series Models (e.g. ARIMA, Prophet)

Deep Learning (TensorFlow / Keras for LSTM)

ArcGIS Software

Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: National Property Information Centre (NAPIC)

Includes:

Quarterly House Price Index by state
