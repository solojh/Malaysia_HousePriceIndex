## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

1. **Forecasting Trends**  
   Forecast the future trends of the Malaysian House Price Index based on historical data using time series analysis.

2. **Spatial Distribution Analysis**  
   Analyze the distribution of the house price index across different Malaysian states and identify regions with higher house price indices using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in predicting house price indices in Malaysia.
