##Malaysian House Price Index Forecasting & Analysis

This project aims to analyze and forecast the Malaysian House Price Index (HPI) using historical data, time series techniques, and deep learning models, along with spatial analysis using GIS.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
Forecasting Trends
To forecast the future trends of the Malaysian House Price Index based on historical data using time series analysis.

Spatial Distribution Analysis
To analyze the distribution of the house price index across different Malaysian states and identify regions with higher house price indices using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

Model Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in predicting house price indices in Malaysia.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.)

Deep Learning (TensorFlow / Keras for LSTM)

GIS Software (QGIS or GeoPandas)

Jupyter Notebook
